#Veil-PowerView

Veil-PowerView is a powershell tool to gain network situational awareness on 
Windows domains. It contains a set of pure-powershell replacements for various 
windows "net *" commands, which utilize powershell AD hooks and underlying 
Win32 API functions to perform useful Windows domain functionality.

It also impements various useful metafunctions, including a port 
of [Rob Fuller's](https://twitter.com/mubix) [netview.exe](https://github.com/mubix/netview) tool,
and some custom-written 'UserHunter' functions which will identify where on the
network specific users are logged into. It can also check which machines
on the domain the current user has local administrator access on. See function
descriptions for appropriate usage and available options.

To run on a machine, start powershell with "powershell -exec bypass" and then load
the powerview script: PS> Import-Module .\powerview.ps1

For detailed output of underlying functionality, pass the -Debug flag to most functions.

For functions that enumerate multiple machines, pass the -Verbose flag to get a
progress status as each host is enumerated.

Individual functions are broken out in ./functions/ for anyone curious.

Veil-PowerView is a part of the [Veil-Framework](https://www.veil-framework.com/) 
and is developed by [@harmj0y](https://twitter.com/harmj0y).
